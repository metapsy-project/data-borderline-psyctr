## **The `data-borderline-psyctr` dataset** ðŸ“Š 


The `data-borderline-psyctr` dataset is a meta-analytic research domain [MARD](https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf)) which is part of the  [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). The dataset contains study information and effect size data of randomized trials on psychotherapy interventions for borderline personality disorder (BPD). The date of the last search update is provided [here](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-borderline-psyctr/blob/main/metadata/last_search.txt). More details about this database can be accessed in the published [network meta-analysis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/which-psychotherapy-is-most-effective-and-acceptable-in-the-treatment-of-adults-with-a-subclinical-borderline-personality-disorder-a-systematic-review-and-network-metaanalysis/70298984575E733A7FDF82E9BCD6A4F2).

This dataset includes psychotherapies for BPD  vs. control comparisons. Effect sizes are provided for two types of outcomes at post-test: 1) overall BPD severity (based on any validated clinician or self-rated instrument for BPD severity) and 2) suicidal behaviour (combined rate of suicide attempts and death by suicide). When more than one BPD instrument is reported in the included trials, effect size dependency is handled by selecting one instrument per study (based on frequency).


The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/).
