The primary outcomes were 1) overall BPD severity and 2) suicidal behaviour defined as the combined rate of suicide attempts (ie reported by participants via questionnaires or during interviews) and death by suicide (ie identified from medical records). Effect sizes were based on the number of participants in the intervention and control condition who had engaged in suicidal behaviour. We accepted any validated clinician or self-rated instrument for overall BPD severity. If a study used more than one scale, we chose the scale that was most frequently used by other included studies. In case overall BPD severity was not measured, single BPD symptoms were extracted, assessed with a valid clinician or self-rated instrument. If trials measured more than one single BPD symptom, we selected those that were measured by most included studies.
